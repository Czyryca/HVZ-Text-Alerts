# HVZ-Text-Alerts
Python script that sends texts through email to those on mailing list when server reports deaths

Both scripts expect the password to umbchvzdeath@gmail.com to be the first argument. 
monitor.py is the main script to be run during week-longs.
sendConfirmation.py texts potential mailing list clients asking for a reply. (It does not do anything with those replies -- they must be manually added to the mailing list)
